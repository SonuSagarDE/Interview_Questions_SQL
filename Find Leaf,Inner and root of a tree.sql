id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
The given structure is always a valid tree.

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.
Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
| 2  | Inner |
| 3  | Leaf  |
| 4  | Leaf  |
| 5  | Leaf  |
+----+-------+

Create table tree
(
id int,
p_id int
);

insert into tree values(1,null);
insert into tree values(2,1);
insert into tree values(3,1);
insert into tree values(4,2);
insert into tree values(5,2);

## Solution

Select id,
Case when p_id is Null then 'Root' 
	when p_id is not null and id in (select distinct p_id from tree) then 'Inner'
    else 'Leaf'
	end as type
from tree;
